## Usage

```bash
$ npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```

This is a client side javascript notebook where you can test your client side javascript 
code instead of using the web browser console. It allows you to save your scripts.

### NOTE: Each code cell is independent of other code cells. This means that declarations you make in a previous cell will not be accessible to other cells.
